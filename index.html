                <p>I specialize in teaching data science and data literacy to non-traditional college students both in-person 
                  and online. Currently, I and a course director for Data Visualization and Modeling, The Aritificial Intelligence Ecoysystem, and 
                  User Experience Research Analytics at <a href="https://www.fullsail.edu">Full Sail University</a> in Winter Park, FL.
                  I focus on creating engaging learning materials for adults who may never have encountered data science in 
                  previous educational experiences. </p>
                       
                <p>Prior to focusing on data science education, I worked as a research statistician in the 
                  <a href="https://klein.ophth.wisc.edu/">Klein Ocular Epidemiology Research Group</a> where
                  I assisted in developing statistical models of eye diseases including age-related macular degeneration and
                  diabetic retinopathy. You can find a list of papers I authored and co-authored on

                <p>Project-Based R Companion to Introductory Statistics is a companion to a 
                  traditional statistics or biostatistics textbook, covering topics such as descriptive 
                  statistics, regression, and hypothesis testing with an emphasis on the 
                  practical skills of testing assumptions, data exploration, and forming conclusions.</p>
                  
                  <p>These projects, intended as a practical, "real-world" alternative to traditional homework 
                    problems, will illustrate how to "put the pieces together" and conduct a complete 
                    start-to-finish data analysis using the R statistical software package.</p> 

                <p>Key Features Include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Organized in chapters focusing on the same topics found in typical introductory statistics textbooks (descriptive statistics, regression, two-way tables, hypothesis testing for means and proportions, etc.) 
                        so instructors can easily pair this supplementary material with course plans</li>
                    <li>Real-world datasets from scientific publications in the fields of history, 
                        pop culture, business, medicine, and forensics for students to analyze</li>
                    <li>Students gain experience working through a variety of statistical analyses 
                      from start to finish</li>
                </ul>
                The book is available from <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Project-%20Based-R-Companion-to-Introductory-Statistics/Myers/p/book/9780367262082">Chapman and Hall</a>

              <p>New large-language AI models are challenging instructors, but can also open new opportunities for teaching and learning. 
                  It's time to move beyond simply <i>policing</i> AI use and show our students how to use AI 
                in a reflective, collaborative way.</p>

                <p>I offer a one-day in-person workshop to help faculty develop AI-first assignments and courses, drawing upon my own
                experience using AI in the classroom, resources I've developed for the Rollins faculty, and the best ideas from other
                leading AI-engaged professors. Attendees will leave with:
                <ul>
                    <li>Concrete examples of successful assignments you can adapt to your own classes</li>
                    <li>Practical tips for designing AI-first courses, including balancing AI and non-AI skills</li>

                The Rollins Community Impact Lab works with nonprofits and community organizations to assess the impact of their programs.
                We use a focus group methodology called <a href="https://extension.umn.edu/community-development/ripple-effect-mapping">Ripple Effect Mapping</a> (REM) to capture the key outcomes of a
                program in the words of its participants and stakeholders. Our projects are collaborative: partners are highly involved in defining the
                    scope of the study, the important questions, and reviewing and validating the results.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each project leads to a whitepaper summarizing the important themes of the REM data and answering questions identified
                    by the partner. <a href="Crave_White_Paper.pdf">Here's an example</a> that we developed in partnership with <a href="https://cravefla.org/">Crave of
                        Central Florida</a>.

                <p>Before joining the Rollins faculty, I received my Ph.D. in computer sciences from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2014, advised by Mary Vernon and Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau.
                    My dissertation developed analytic performance models for storage systems and new approximations for queue length distributions.
                    Prior to attending UW, I worked as a software engineer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, applying computer vision
                    algorithms to national security problems. My bachelor's and master's degrees are from the University of Florida.
